## What I Build

I architect **production-grade agentic AI systems** where autonomous agents don't just execute tasks—they plan strategies, make decisions, use tools dynamically, and adapt to complex environments. My work sits at the intersection of large language models, multi-agent orchestration, and real-world system integration.

**Specialized in:**

- **Multi-Agent Architectures** — Designing systems where specialized agents collaborate, delegate, and collectively solve problems beyond single-model capabilities
- **MCP Protocol Development** — Building Model Context Protocol servers that give AI agents structured access to external systems and tools
- **Tool-Use & Function Calling** — Creating intelligent agents that autonomously decide when and how to use external tools and APIs
- **Memory & State Management** — Implementing persistent memory systems that allow agents to learn, remember, and improve over time
- **Production AI Systems** — Deploying scalable, reliable agentic systems handling thousands of autonomous decisions daily

## Philosophy

**Agents over Chatbots** — I build systems that take action, not just conversation.

**Intelligence through Architecture** — Complex behavior emerges from well-designed agent interactions, not just bigger models.

**Production-First** — Every system I build is designed for scale, reliability, and real-world deployment from day one.

**Open Source Advocate** — Contributing tools, SDKs, and frameworks that make agentic AI accessible to developers worldwide.

## Current Work

🔬 **Researching** — Advanced planning algorithms for multi-agent systems and dynamic tool composition strategies

🛠️ **Building** — Next-generation MCP servers that unlock new capabilities for AI agents across domains

📝 **Writing** — Technical deep-dives on agentic AI architecture, LangGraph patterns, and production deployment strategies

🎯 **Exploring** — Voice-enabled agents, real-time multi-modal systems, and agent-to-agent communication protocols

## Technical Approach

I don't chase hype—I solve problems. My approach centers on:

**1. Agent Design Patterns**
- Implementing proven patterns: ReAct, Plan-and-Execute, Reflection
- Building modular, composable agent architectures
- Designing clear agent roles and responsibilities

**2. Tool Integration**
- Creating rich tool ecosystems for agents
- Smart tool selection based on context
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

**3. Memory Systems**
- Short-term (conversation) and long-term (persistent) memory
- Semantic search over past interactions
- Learning from feedback loops

**4. Production Deployment**
- Monitoring and observability for agent decisions
- Rate limiting and cost optimization
- Security-first implementation
